This code was written around Christmas 2010 and ran quite well on the latest non-LTS Ubuntu Linux release available at that time.  Even so, I think the
code presented here saw some changes since then, which may or may not have been tested.  Add onto that the fact that I haven't run this code in over a
year, and, you can see that I'm not 100% confident in how well this code may hold up as-is.  Of course, I do intend to go back, and ensure this all is
working reasonably at some point sooner rather than later.

The following HollyHug-sourced legal and licensing details apply:
+ The initial commit to subversion very likely contains binaries that I do not have the license to redistribute.  I am making this commit with the full
  admission that this several-years-old project directory is an absolute mess, and, I am making no effort to pirate anything by providing this massive
  repository.  If you are a member of a legal representation team who is investigating improper redistribution of your binaries, do us both a favor and
  save us all a lot of money, just tell me that your binary shouldn't be here and I will immediately remove it.  Again, I apologize in advance for any
  binaries whose licenses went unchecked here, but this repo has locally been such a mess that it would be nearly impossible for me to repudiate every
  little thing on my own that shouldn't be there.
+ To any artists (especially the rather "fuzzy" ones) who see art here that they don't want represented, let me know, I will remove it upon request.  I
  will also be doing some autonomous cleanup of these assets as I move towards my rebranding goals here.
