EveryOS Companion
"Make every OS better!"
Native versions for Windows, Linux, and MacOS!

These three programs serve to make your computer work better, make it smarter, and make it more reliable.  Soon, I will have an official web site for
these, so you know exactly "what you're getting" with each of these.

Here's what OS each is for:

HollyHug -> Windows  (formerly "The HollyHug Windows Toolkit")
MobiLyon -> Linux    (formerly "MobiLyon" and never before public!)
Roshteka -> MacOS X  (formerly "Roshteka" and never before public!)

(NOTE: at the time of this writing, Roshteka isn't yet committed to GitHub, but I am actively working on this directly after committing this README...)
