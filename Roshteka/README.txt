This is Roshteka, the EveryOS Companion for Mac OS X, designed on and for Mac OS X "Lion."  WARNING: I believe I have used features here which are not
supported prior to Lion, and as such, I will NEVER officially support this running on any Mac OS X release earlier than Lion.

LATE BREAKING RELEASE INFORMATION:
+ ProTip(TM): the heading is just to make sure you read this, since, it is my opinion that this following item is really important.
+ There are a number of documents in the root level of the Roshteka source tree.  These may make reference to the code being for private testing only,
  and I just wish to assure the new user that these are outdated and are only being provided here for historical reference.

KNOWN ISSUE:
Roshteka is the one EveryOS Companion version that is initially being committed with a known issue...
+ Roshteka may stop refreshing the system's power status (both UPS and portable system battery) at random, but usually, this is only seen when the Mac
  is left to sleep for more than a few minutes.  This is a well-known issue, and as time goes on, I will see if I can nail down what's causing it.

The following HollyHug-sourced legal and licensing details apply:
+ The initial commit to subversion very likely contains binaries that I do not have the license to redistribute.  I am making this commit with the full
  admission that this several-years-old project directory is an absolute mess, and, I am making no effort to pirate anything by providing this massive
  repository.  If you are a member of a legal representation team who is investigating improper redistribution of your binaries, do us both a favor and
  save us all a lot of money, just tell me that your binary shouldn't be here and I will immediately remove it.  Again, I apologize in advance for any
  binaries whose licenses went unchecked here, but this repo has locally been such a mess that it would be nearly impossible for me to repudiate every
  little thing on my own that shouldn't be there.
+ To any artists (especially the rather "fuzzy" ones) who see art here that they don't want represented, let me know, I will remove it upon request.  I
  will also be doing some autonomous cleanup of these assets as I move towards my rebranding goals here.
