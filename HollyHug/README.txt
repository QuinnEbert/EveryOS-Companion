The HollyHug Windows Toolkit
"Now in generally-available source code format!"

UP FRONT:
+ HollyHug is becoming an integrated part of my "EveryOS Companion" software set.  As we go forward you will see names like "HollyHug," "MobiLyon," and
  "Roshteka" replaced by references to "EveryOS Companion."  This is happening in my growing professional style, and, as a committment to do proper
  service to the artists who may (or may not) have liked whatever promotion these names and representations may have provided.

IMPORTANT LEGAL LICENSE INFORMATION:
+ The initial commit to subversion very likely contains binaries that I do not have the license to redistribute.  I am making this commit with the full
  admission that this several-years-old project directory is an absolute mess, and, I am making no effort to pirate anything by providing this massive
  repository.  If you are a member of a legal representation team who is investigating improper redistribution of your binaries, do us both a favor and
  save us all a lot of money, just tell me that your binary shouldn't be here and I will immediately remove it.  Again, I apologize in advance for any
  binaries whose licenses went unchecked here, but this repo has locally been such a mess that it would be nearly impossible for me to repudiate every
  little thing on my own that shouldn't be there.
+ To any artists (especially the rather "fuzzy" ones) who see art here that they don't want represented, let me know, I will remove it upon request.  I
  will also be doing some autonomous cleanup of these assets as I move towards my rebranding goals here.

THE LICENSE OF HOLLYHUG:
+ The Visual Basic Code presented here, except where otherwise represented, is provided to you as-is, with no warranty or guarantee of any type, that's
  including the possibly implied warranties of merchantability and/or guarantees of fitness for a particular purpose.
+ The Visual Basic Code presented here is provided so that you may audit what I have created, it may NOT be used within your own releases without prior
  written agreement between you and myself (possibly including a license fee depending on nature of your project), and you may NOT make this code
  available elsewhere without written permission.
+ You MAY tinker around with this code for your own experimentation so long as the results of this experimentation are ONLY used by yourself.  Other
  use of this code is prohibited without prior written permission from myself (possibly including a license fee depending on nature of your project).

FULL DISCLOSURE:
+ Passwords were repudiated from certain files in this project.  Some of the files that passwords were repudiated from do NOT include a "FIXME" at the
  top indicating this was done, however, those source code files were similarly NOT tested for compilability before release to the repo.
