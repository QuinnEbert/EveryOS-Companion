This is the dist directory used by Py2Exe (at one point I did check MobiLyon could work on Windows).  Following is my list of files that were in this
directory before I cleaned it.  I cannot commit a lot of these files for legal reasons.  You may wish to consult a search engine or your Windows files
if you need copies of these -- or, rather, the ones that are Microsoft files -- some of these *are* legal to distribute but were actually removed to
save me quota space on GitHub.
